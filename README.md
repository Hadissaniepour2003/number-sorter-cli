# Number Sorter CLI

This is a basic Python script that takes integer inputs from the user and filters them into 1s, 2s, and 3s. It then prints the full math expression and the total sum.

This was my first university Python project and was mainly written to get comfortable with loops, conditionals, and simple list handling.

## How to Run

```bash
python number_sorter.py
Enter a number: 1
Enter a number: 2
Enter a number: 1
Enter a number: 3
Enter a number: -1

1+2+1+3 = 7
[1, 2, 1, 3]
