# Number Sorter CLI ðŸ§®

A simple command-line Python program that categorizes user input into 1s, 2s, and 3s, calculates the total sum, and prints the result as a mathematical expression.

> ðŸ§ª *This was my first university Python project â€” focused on learning loops, conditionals, and list handling.*

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Accepts integer inputs from the user
- Categorizes numbers into three separate groups (1, 2, or 3)
- Ignores all other values except -1 (which ends the program)
- Computes and prints the full addition expression and total sum
- Displays all entered 1s, 2s, and 3s together as a list

## ðŸ’» How to Run

```bash
python number_sorter.py
enter a number: 1  
enter a number: 2  
enter a number: 1  
enter a number: 3  
enter a number: -1  
1+2+1+3 = 7  
[1, 2, 1, 3]
